You need 3 terminals:
    1. for the frontend. Cd into it and type
        - npm start
    2. cd backend and use command python main.py
    3. cd backend and use the command: npx ts-node src/index.ts

    So do this in this order: 2->3->1
    And of course you need to download all the necessary dependencies such as express etc
    Future work, dockerize this project
