Tech learnings:
    LLM:
        - An LLM is an AI model trained on a huge amount of text data (like books, websites, code, etc.) that can understand and generate human-like language.
        - Examples include:
            ChatGPT (by OpenAI)
            Gemini etc
        - What can they do?
            Summarize text
            Write code or emails
            Analyze documents etc
    Node.js:
        - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on a server.
    Why is that important?
        - Traditionally, JavaScript only ran in browsers to make websites interactive.
        - Node.js lets you write backend/server-side applications in JavaScript.

    So instead of using languages like Python, Java, or PHP for backend code, you can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend.
    MongoDB:
        - NoSQL database
